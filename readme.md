# Node Server
This is a basic informational site created with Node.js. In this project, I learned how to create a server in Node. 

You can navigate to the different pages, which when clicked will serve their correct HTML files.

CSS and Javsacript files are also loaded.

[Prism](https://prismjs.com/index.html) is used for styling the code block on the About page.

A 404.html file is loaded for any pages with invalid paths.

I mostly referred to [Traversy Media's Node.js Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBNz5xF-Kx4&t=950s) for setting this project up.
